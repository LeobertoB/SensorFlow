# SensorFlow

A sophisticated simulation of a 3D sensor network with dynamic behavior, self-healing capabilities, and realistic failure modes.

## Features

- 3D sensor placement and visualization
- Dynamic sensor movement and degradation
- Multiple sensor types support
- Network self-healing capabilities
- Realistic failure simulation
- Performance metrics and analysis
- Interactive 3D visualization
- Cost-benefit analysis

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SensorFlow.git

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Basic usage:

```python
from src.simulation import NetworkSimulation
from src.config import SimulationConfig

# Create and run a simulation
config = SimulationConfig()
simulation = NetworkSimulation(config)
simulation.run(steps=10)
```
